Rorschach ppm for Half-Life

'Dog Carcass in alley this morning, tire tread on burst stomach. This city is afraid of me. I have seen it's true face.
 The streets are extended gutters and the gutters are full of blood and when the drains finally scab over, all the vermin will drown.
 The accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up about their waists and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout "save us!"...
 ...and I'll look down and whisper "no."

 Enter Rorschach, non-compromising masked vigilante with questionable ethics in what has to be one of the most compelling and involved graphic novels I have ever read, The Watchmen by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. 

The model itself is 478 triangles/faces/polys - whatever you want to call them. Uses standard Valve animations and was built using Studio MAX and Character Studio (naturally).
It has one 256x256 skin made in Photoshop.

Okay, I built this one in an afternoon because I needed an alter-ego for a Half-Life LAN party and because a friend of mine claimed the Spawn model, so it's not really the best I can do but as I have no intention of really going back and improving it, I figured I would release it as is, anyway.

To install the model, unzip the Rorschach zip file into the
Sierra/Half-Life/Valve/Models/Player folder.
It will automatically create a folder called 'Rorschach' and place the model and character pic in it.

Have fun, and above all - treat yourself to a copy of the Watchmen today!

 "Looked at sky through smoke heavy with human fat and God was not there. the cold, suffocating dark goes on forever and we are alone.
 "Live our lives lacking anything better to do. Devise reason later.
 "Born from oblivion; Bear children, Hell-bound as ourselves; Go into oblivion.
 "There is nothing else."
 Existence is Random. Has no pattern save what we imagine after staring at it for too long.
