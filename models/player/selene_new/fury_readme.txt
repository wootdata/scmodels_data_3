fury_161's Selene Master Death Dealer 2.0

Some neat new stuff, it looks a lot more like her for one thing. Mostly texture fixes, but you'll notice a bunch of model fixes too. You may notice some weird deformation, but I thought it was worth it to maintain a more femenine figure. I mean, you aren't really going to notice the wrists in combat anyway. Same goes for the shoulders, however most problems with elbows and knees have been fixed.
